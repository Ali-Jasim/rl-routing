## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started using rl-routing is to open up the 
[Shortest Path Base Case in Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/LukeWood/rl-routing/blob/master/notebooks/shortest-path-base-case.ipynb).  This base case runs you through processing observations, setting up the environment, and creating a shortest path agent.
